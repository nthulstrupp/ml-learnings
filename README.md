I have decided to read up on and get some more learnings about machine learning I got input for this learning list from George P. :) 




## 1. Brushing up my python skills 
I used hackerrank as a free and good learning platform

## 2. Completing the Coursera course Machine Learning by Andrew Ng 
This course provided great basic math

## 3. Getting my basic stat skills back on track 
... Is the sample biased or not?

Interesting paper about the p-values/p-value hacking:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07532.pdf

“For an observed p-value of, say, .02, the “true” p-value is likely to be >.1 (and very possibly close to .2)”



## 4. Implemening Neural Networks 

Starting from scratch you some times learn more

## 5. Tensor flow examples 

Tensorflow to implement some more complex ML architectures.

Here I was reading the Reasearch papers like:
